# Introduction

## About / Features

The `R` extension package `sensorweb4R` provides functions and classes to download data from sensor web services. These services contain timeseries of sensor data, such as temperature measurements of weather stations or pollution data from air quality stations. You can retrieve specific subsets of data from the services using plain R function calls. These datasets are loaded into your session as ready-to-use data structures.

Currently, the following web service APIs are supported:

* [52North Timeseries API](https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/SensorWebClientRESTInterface)

    The Timeseries API is a web service interface to publish and explore time series data in a way that is tailored to thin web clients, e.g. JavaScript. It uses a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) approach and returns data encoded in [JSON](http://json.org/).

    It supports different kinds of storage backends such as direct database access or being a proxy for OGC SOS.

A related package is `sos4R` ([on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sos4R)), which provides similar functionality to download timeseries from a standardized OGC Sensor Observation Service.

## Quick Start

The `sensorweb4R` package is not on CRAN yet, so please download and install the package manually, for example using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("52North/sensorweb4R")
```

Then load the package and take a look at the help, demos, and the vignette:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(sensorweb4R)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sensorweb4R
demo(package = "sensorweb4R")
vignette(package = "sensorweb4R")
vignette("<name of the vignette to open")
```

Some API endpoints to explore are build in:

```{r}
sensorweb4R:::sensorweb_api_endpoints()
```

## Terms and Definitions

* **Sensor Web** and **OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)**: "The concept of the "sensor web" is a type of sensor network that is especially well suited for environmental monitoring. [...] OGC's Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework defines a suite of web service interfaces and communication protocols abstracting from the heterogeneity of sensor (network) communication." [1]


# Accessing the Timeseries API

For detailed information about the Timeseries API, please check the [API documentation](http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/sensorwebclient-webapp-stable/api-doc/index.html), which provides the normative definitions of terms and functions used or explained in this document.

## Common query parameters

http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/sensorwebclient-webapp-stable/api-doc/index.html#general-common-query-parameters

## Exploring Available Timeseries

Tasks a user should be able to do:

* querying / searching with keywords, ..
* exploring stations/timeseries (these are the main concepts of the API)
* downloading timeseries data and metadata

Notes for development:

* Goal: mirror the structure of objects of the API
* classes for objects defined by the API, supporting both "id/label" and "extended" versions
    * `Timeseries`
    * `Station`
    * `Service`
    * `Category`
    * `Phenomenon`
    * `SearchResult`
    * `Collection`
    * Super-class: TimeseriesAPIObject, which has a 'version' slot
* Paging: was planned at some point and is partially specified (only the headers) but is not implemented
* geometries use GeoJSON, check if there is a package with parsing functions for the geometries used in Timeseries API (leafletR has only ..toGeoJSON functions)

## Caching

All requests to specific resources (e.g. stations, phenomenons, etc.) are cached by `sensorweb4R` in the global variable ``.sensorweb4R.cache` to reduce HTTP requests to the Timeseries API. The cache contains the JSON responses (parsed by `jsonlite`) by their respective URL; collections of resources are not cached. You can inspect the cache using the convenience functions `get.cache`, `get.cache.value` and `get.cache.keys` or manipulate it using `clear.cache`, `set.cache`, `set.cache.value` and `set.cache.values`.

### Example code for discussion of development paradigm

Using **S4 classes**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
endpoint <- SensorwebEndpoint(url = "http://sensorweb.server.org/api/v1")

sw_search(endpoint, q = "search term")
# a list of matching objects of all types

sw_search(endpoint, q = "search term", deep = TRUE)
# a list of extended objects, i.e. the package automatically cals the contained hrefs for all results

sw_search(endpoint, q = "search term", deep = TRUE, filter = c("station", "procedure"), dismiss = FALSE)
# deep search only for results of the listed types, but other types are still contained in the result list
# a list of extended objects of classes Station and Procedure

timeseries(endpoint)
# a list of Timeseries objects, all available series

timeseries(endpoint, category = "..", service = "..", station = "..", phenomenon = "..")
# a list of Timeseries fitting the defined criteria, which can be ids from the API or their labels

# extended query parameters can be lists of ids, labels, or objects of the class:
timeseries(endpoint, category = list("Air", "cat_123", categories(endpoint)[[1:2]]))

t <- timeseries(endpoint)[[42]]
url_of(t, full = TRUE)
# a character vector with the full URL to the timeseries resource ../stations/ts_adfsasdf

reference_values(t)
# lists representing the json objects, no class

parameters(t)

firstValue(t)
lastValue(t)
# returns a vector of length one with a numeric value and the time stamp as an attribute

range(t)
# returns c(firstValue(t), lastValue(t))

getData(t, content = "applicaton/json") # default

getData(t, content = "applicaton/json", servie = "..", category = "..", phenomenon = "..")
# filter with common query paremeters

# the following are POST requests!
getData(t, content = "image/png or application/pdf", file = .., style = list())
# stores image at the given location, or in workspace

getData(timeseries(endpoint)[[3:6]], ...)
# request multiple timeseries

getData(t, ..., expanded = TRUE, timespan = "PT12H/2013-08-06")
# query temporal timespan, see xts:::.makeISO8601

# query data nicely with lubridate Period class
getData(t, ..., timespan = minutes(x = 60))

# query rendedred timeseries with style and other rendeing options - minimal support only!
getData(t, ..., renderingOptions = list(style = '{ "chartType": "line", ...}', legend = TRUE, generalize = TRUE, format = .., ))


services(endpoint)
stations(endpoint, extended = TRUE)
phenomena(endpoint)
procedures(endpoint)
features(endpoint)
offerings(endpoint)
categories(endpoint)
# a list of respective objects, all available ones - could also check the collections if these are supported/available


collections(endpoint)
# a list of Collection objects, listing all the available collection types and names, could be used for extended printing methods
# this should probably be called directly when creating a new SensorwebEndpoint

print(collections(endpoint)[[2]])
# prints a collection object
c <- collections(endpoint)[[2]]
c$id; c$label; c$description; c$size


s <- services(endpoint, extended = TRUE)
is_extended([[1]])
# returns TRUE

s[["quantities"]] # a slot of the class
s@serviceURL # a slot of the class
s@supportsFirstLatest # returns boolean value

services(endpoint, category = "..", station = "..", phenomenon = "..")
# a list of Services objects using common query parameters

services(endpoint, id = "srv_1234", ...)
# an object of class Service, cal also use common query parameters?

services(endpoint, id = c("srv_1234", "srv_567"))
# a list of objects of class Service


categories(endpoint)
# a names list of the categories
# list("Air" = "cat_1234", "Water" = "cat_567")


stations(endpoint, id = c("st_123", "st_456", "Brussels"), expanded = TRUE)
# a list of the stations with the given identifiers or labels

stations(endpoint, category = "..", service = "..", phenomenon = "..")
# common query parameters

stations(endpoint, ...)
# commons query parameters can be extracted from "..."

stations(endpoint, ..., crs = "EPSG:25832", bbox = box, near = list(center=c(7,52), radius = 100), )
# optional query parameters, can also utilize sp classes here, namely CRS here; bbox has the format of sp:::bbox

st <- stations(endpoint)[[1]]

bbox(st)
geometry(st)
# retrieves an object of class Spatial representing the location of the station, see sp::geometry
coordinates(geometry(st))
```

Similar to above, but showing how this would work with **reference classes**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
endpoint$search(q = "search term")

endpoint$timeseries()
# a list of Timeseries objects, all available series

t <- endpoint$timeseries()[[42]]
t$data(...)

endpoint$stations(...)
endpoint$services(...)
endpoint$categories(...)
endpoint$phenomena(...)

# ... and so forth

```

## GETting Data

* downloading timeseries data
<!--
render nice tables with
```{r, results = "asis"}
pander::pandoc.table(iris[1:3, 1:4])
```
-->
* request time ranges
* request specific stations, services, categories, phenomena
* displaying / plotting examples (including `openair`)
* requesting server-side plotted images, saving to workspace

Testing of parsing with `jsonlite`:


```{r, message=FALSE}
require(jsonlite)
require(RJSONIO)
require(lubridate)
```

```{r timesries}
singleTimeseries <- '{
  "values": [
    {
      "timestamp": 1376524800000,
      "value": 433.0
    },
     {
      "timestamp": 1376524860000,
      "value": 432.4
    },
    {
      "timestamp": 1376524920000,
      "value": 432.0
    },
    {
      "timestamp": 1376524980000,
      "value": 431.1
    }
  ]
}'

multipleTimeseries <- '{
  "ts_ad3edeff973ab62e39f76c14f95d1e82": {
    "values": [
        {
          "timestamp": 1376524920000,
          "value": 432.0
        },
        {
          "timestamp": 1376524980000,
          "value": 431.1
        }
    ]
  },
  "ts_c8ed5ddbb89c19b2e385de23eecbde98": {
    "values": [
      {
        "timestamp": 1376589600000,
        "value": 546
      },
      {
        "timestamp": 1376589660000,
        "value": 546.6
      },
      {
        "timestamp": 1376589720000,
        "value": 547
      }
    ]
  }
}'

# works well:
jsonlite::fromJSON(txt = singleTimeseries)

# does NOT work well:
RJSONIO::fromJSON(content = singleTimeseries)

# works well:
jsonlite::fromJSON(txt = multipleTimeseries)

# weird:
RJSONIO::fromJSON(content = multipleTimeseries)
```

```{r, timestuff}
# not working yet!
test_series <- jsonlite::fromJSON(txt = singleTimeseries)
lubridate::parse_date_time(x = test_series$values$timestamp, orders = "OS")

as.POSIXct(test_series$values$timestamp/1000, origin = "1970-01-01")
```

```{r categories}
categoryCollection <- '[
  {
    "id": "cat_h7234u",
    "label": "Water"
  },
  {
    "id": "cat_eddfnq",
    "label": "Air"
  }
]'

categoryItem <- '{
  "id": "cat_eddfnq",
  "label": "Air",
  "service": {
    "id": "../services/srv_823sd",
    "label": "PEGELONLINE"
  }
}'

cc <- jsonlite::fromJSON(txt = categoryCollection)
cc

# array to named list
ccList <- as.list(cc$id)
names(ccList) <- cc$label
ccList

jsonlite::fromJSON(txt = categoryItem)
```


# Options

## Logging

`sensorweb4R` uses the package [futile.logger](http://cran.r-project.org/package=futile.logger) for logging and by default prints log statements only to the console. The default logging level is `INFO` can can be changed with `flog.threshold(<level>, name = "sensorweb4R")` to one of `TRACE` (most detailed), `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL` (least verbose).

You can configure the level of the logger and log files and much more - just check the logging package documentation with `?futile.logger`.
