# Introduction

## About / Features

The `R` extension package `sensorweb4R` provides functions and classes to download data from sensor web services. These services contain timeseries of sensor data, such as temperature measurements of weather stations or pollution data from air quality stations. You can retrieve specific subsets of data from the services using plain R function calls. These datasets are loaded into your session as ready-to-use data structures.

Currently, the following web service APIs are supported:

* [52North Timeseries API](https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/SensorWebClientRESTInterface)

    The Timeseries API is a web service interface to publish and explore time series data in a way that is tailored to thin web clients, e.g. JavaScript. It uses a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) approach and returns data encoded in [JSON](http://json.org/).

    It supports different kinds of storage backends such as direct database access or being a proxy for OGC SOS.

A related package is `sos4R` ([on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sos4R)), which provides similar functionality to download timeseries from a standardized OGC Sensor Observation Service.

## Quick Start

The `sensorweb4R` package is not on CRAN yet, so please download and install the package manually, for example using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("52North/sensorweb4R", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Then load the package and take a look at the help and the vignette:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(sensorweb4R)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sensorweb4R
demo(package = "sensorweb4R")
vignette(package = "sensorweb4R")
vignette("<name of the vignette to open")
```

The package contains several demos for different aspects of the package. The demo `ircel-celine` is a good starting point:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
demo(package = "sensorweb4R")
demo("ircel-celine")
```

Some konwn API endpoints are build in to start exploring sensor web data on your own:

```{r}
sensorweb4R::example.endpoints()
```

## Terms and Definitions

* **Sensor Web** and **OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)**: "The concept of the "sensor web" is a type of sensor network that is especially well suited for environmental monitoring. [...] OGC's Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework defines a suite of web service interfaces and communication protocols abstracting from the heterogeneity of sensor (network) communication." [1]
* **Endpoint**: An endpoints represents an instance of a Timeseries API.
* **Service**: The endpoint encapsulates multiple data providers (e.g. SOS). These are represented as services.


* **Station**: A station is a concept that does not directly exist in the SOS object model. It can be seen as a stationary sensor with an geometry that can aggregate one or multiple offerings, features, phenomenons and procedures and thus can have multiple timeseries.

* **Timeseries**: Timeseries are the central part of the API. They contain series of data over time that is associated with an offering, feature, phenomenon and procedure.
* **Domain resources**: Domain resources are concepts, that are mapped one-to-one to their respective counterpart in the SOS model. To allow the API to provide data of multiple services, new identifiers are generated for these objects, while original identifier, which is only unique in the context of a single service, becomes the `domainId`.

    * **Offering**: An abstract concept similar to layers in mapping services. It allows to group observations of different phenomenons or features (and for SOS v1.0.0 also procedures).
    * **Feature**: The spatial object of which the observation is made.
    * **Phenomenon**: The observed occurence.
    * **Procedure**: The physical sensor that observed the phenomenon, or abstract process that processed the observations.
* **Category**: A concept to group multiple timeseries together.


# Accessing the Timeseries API

For detailed information about the Timeseries API, please check the [API documentation](http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/sensorwebclient-webapp-stable/api-doc/index.html), which provides the normative definitions of terms and functions used or explained in this document.

## General concept

To download data the following three steps must be implemented in a script

1. Connect to an endpoint
2. Fetch content information (metadata) from the endpoint, i.e. available phenomena, timeseries, ...
3. Download data

## Common query parameters

<!-- TODO -->

http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/sensorwebclient-webapp-stable/api-doc/index.html#general-common-query-parameters

## Exploring Available Timeseries

### Connecting to an endpoint

```{r}
# connect
endpoint <- example.endpoints()[1]

# get all services
srv <- services(endpoint)

# get the names of the services
label(srv)

# subset services
srv <- srv[5]

# get all phenomena
phe <- phenomena(endpoint)

# get the names of the phenomena
head(label(phe))
```


### Exploring stations of a service

```{r}
# get all stations
sta <- stations(srv)
head(label(sta))

# filter by category
cat <- categories(srv)
sta <- stations(srv, category = cat[1])
head(label(sta))
```

Stations are spatial objects containing a geometry:
```{r}
geom <- sp::geometry(sta)
head(geom)
```


### Exploring timeseries of a service

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get all timeseries
ts <- timeseries(srv)
```
```{r}

# filter by station
ts <- timeseries(sta[1])
# equivalent
# sta <- timeseries(endpoint, station = sta[1])
# sta <- timeseries(endpoint, station = id(sta[1]))


# filter by category
ts <- timeseries(endpoint, category = cat[1])[1:2]
# equivalent:
# ts <- timeseries(endpoint, category = id(cat[2]))
```

### Accessing relations and attributes

Timeseries are complex classes with relations to nearly all other classes:
```{r}
str(ts, max.level = 2)
```

To save bandwith, most relations are not filled:
```{r}
category(ts)
```

If you really need the meta data you can `fetch` them:
```{r}
ts <- fetch(ts)
```

Now you can access the relations using the respective getter:

* `phenomenon(ts)`
* `service(ts)`
* `offering(ts)`
* `feature(ts)`
* `procedure(ts)`
* `category(ts)`
* `station(ts)`
* `procedure(ts)`

E.g. to get the procedures of the timeseries:
```{r}
label(procedure(ts))
```

### Searching by keyword

Not implemented yet.

<!--sw_search(endpoint, q = "search term", deep = TRUE)
# a list of extended objects, i.e. the package automatically cals the contained hrefs for all results
-->

### Downloading data

```{r}
# as the timespan of the series is quite large...
lubridate::duration(lubridate::new_interval(time(firstValue(ts)), 
                                            time(lastValue(ts))))

# ... we should filter the data we want
# e.g. the last common week of data
last <- min(time(lastValue(ts)))
time <- lubridate::as.interval(lubridate::weeks(1), last - lubridate::weeks(1))
data <- getData(ts, timespan = time)
str(data)
```

Have a look at `?lubridate` for further examples on how to express time intervals in `R`.
<!--
```{r, results = "asis"}
pander::pandoc.table(as.data.frame(data[[1]]))
```
-->

### Using data for further analysis

```{r}
# coercion to timeseries 
ts <- ts[1]
data <- data[[1]]

xlab <- "Time"
ylab <- paste0(names(phenomenon(ts)), " (", uom(ts), ")")
main <- names(ts)

# convert to zoo
x <- zoo::as.zoo(data)
plot(x, main = main, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab)

# convert to xts
x <- xts::as.xts(data)
plot(x, main = main, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab)

# coercion to data.frame
x <- as.data.frame(data)
plot(x, main = main, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab)

# summary and histogram
summary(data)
hist(data)

# coercion to Spatial stuff
as.SpatialPointsDataFrame(sta)
```

### Currently unsupported features of the timeseries API

* Collections
* Server-side plots

### Caching

All requests to resources of the API are cached in a global `list` that can be accessed using `get.cache` and `set.cache`. The list contains the parsed JSON responses of the service for each resource:

```{r}
get.cache.keys()
```

```{r}
str(get.cache.value(get.cache.keys()[1]))
```

For more information consult `?cache`.

# Options

## Logging

`sensorweb4R` uses the package [futile.logger](http://cran.r-project.org/package=futile.logger) for logging and by default prints log statements only to the console. The default logging level is `INFO` can can be changed with `flog.threshold(<level>, name = "sensorweb4R")` to one of `TRACE` (most detailed), `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL` (least verbose).

You can configure the level of the logger and log files and much more - just check the logging package documentation with `?futile.logger`.
