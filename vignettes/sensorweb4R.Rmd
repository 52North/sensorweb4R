# Introduction

## About / Features

The `R` extension package `sensorweb4R` provides functions and classes to download data from sensor web services. These services contain timeseries of sensor data, such as temperature measurements of weather stations or pollution data from air quality stations. You can retrieve specific subsets of data from the services using plain R function calls. These datasets are loaded into your session as ready-to-use data structures.

Currently, the following web service APIs are supported:

* [52North Timeseries API](https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/SensorWebClientRESTInterface)

    The Timeseries API is a web service interface to publish and explore time series data in a way that is tailored to thin web clients, e.g. JavaScript. It uses a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) approach and returns data encoded in [JSON](http://json.org/).

    It supports different kinds of storage backends such as direct database access or being a proxy for OGC SOS.

A related package is `sos4R` ([on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sos4R)), which provides similar functionality to download timeseries from a standardized OGC Sensor Observation Service.

## Quick Start

The `sensorweb4R` package is not on CRAN yet, so please download and install the package manually, for example using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("52North/sensorweb4R")
```

Then load the package and take a look at the help and the vignette:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(sensorweb4R)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sensorweb4R
demo(package = "sensorweb4R")
vignette(package = "sensorweb4R")
vignette("<name of the vignette to open")
```

The package contains several demos for different aspects of the package. The demo `ircel-celine` is a good starting point:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
demo(package = "sensorweb4R")
demo("ircel-celine")
```

Some konwn API endpoints are build in to start exploring sensor web data on your own:

```{r}
sensorweb4R:::sensorweb_api_endpoints()
```

## Terms and Definitions

* **Sensor Web** and **OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)**: "The concept of the "sensor web" is a type of sensor network that is especially well suited for environmental monitoring. [...] OGC's Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework defines a suite of web service interfaces and communication protocols abstracting from the heterogeneity of sensor (network) communication." [1]

# Accessing the Timeseries API

For detailed information about the Timeseries API, please check the [API documentation](http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/sensorwebclient-webapp-stable/api-doc/index.html), which provides the normative definitions of terms and functions used or explained in this document.

## General concept

To download data the following three steps must be implemented in a script

1. Connect to an endpoint
2. Fetch content information (metadata) from the endpoint, i.e. available phenomena, timeseries, ...
3. Download data

## Common query parameters

<!-- TODO -->

http://sensorweb.demo.52north.org/sensorwebclient-webapp-stable/api-doc/index.html#general-common-query-parameters

## Exploring Available Timeseries

### Connecting to an endpoint

```{r}
# connect

# get all services

# get all phenomena
```


### Exploring stations of a service

```{r}
# get all stations

# filter by category
```


### Exploring timeseries of a service

```{r}
# get all timeseries

# filter by station (object and id)

# filter by category (object and id)
```

### Searching by keyword

Not implemented yet.

<!--sw_search(endpoint, q = "search term", deep = TRUE)
# a list of extended objects, i.e. the package automatically cals the contained hrefs for all results
-->

### Downloading data

```{r}
# get data of single timeseries

# filter by category, station, phenomena, ...

# temporal filters (using lubridate): this year, last month, last x hours, january 2014, 2013
```
<!--
render nice tables with
```{r, results = "asis"}
pander::pandoc.table(iris[1:3, 1:4])
```
-->

### Using data for further analysis

```{r}
# coercion to timeseries 

# simple plot

# coercion to data.frame

# summary and histogram

# coercion to Spatial stuff
```

### Currently unsupported features of the timeseries API

* Collections
* Server-side plots


# Options

## Logging

`sensorweb4R` uses the package [futile.logger](http://cran.r-project.org/package=futile.logger) for logging and by default prints log statements only to the console. The default logging level is `INFO` can can be changed with `flog.threshold(<level>, name = "sensorweb4R")` to one of `TRACE` (most detailed), `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL` (least verbose).

You can configure the level of the logger and log files and much more - just check the logging package documentation with `?futile.logger`.

# Source Code
